The IoT Vest project integrates multiple health-monitoring sensors into a wearable vest, designed for ergonomic comfort. It includes a temperature sensor, a blood pressure sensor, and a heart rate monitor. The sensors are managed by a central motherboard and powered by a reliable power supply, with all components designed and positioned using SolidWorks and AutoCAD. The vest gathers real-time data, which is displayed on a graphical interface. The software, written in Java, periodically updates sensor readings and checks for any abnormal values, triggering alerts if necessary. This project aims to provide continuous health monitoring through a comfortable, wearable solution.
